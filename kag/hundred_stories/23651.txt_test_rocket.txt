he examined the label of his bottle of whiskey very carefully. a good brand of whiskey. he seems quite happy in the storeroom. you know, captain, what puzzled me at first he can't read. he can't read anything, not even the instruments in that ship. in fact he shows no interest in his rocket at all. the captain sat down now. he sat at the desk and faced the doctor. at least _they_ had the courage to send a man, not a mouse. doctor, a man. the doctor stared at the captain, his hand squeezing and unsqueezing on the whiskey bottle. a man who can't read his own instruments the doctor laughed. perhaps you too have failed to see the point like that stupid general who sits out there waiting for the men from somewhere to invade don't you think it's a possibility the doctor nodded. a very good possibility, captain, but they will not be men. the doctor seemed to pause and lean forward. that rocket, captain, is a test rocket. a test rocket _just like ours_ then the doctor picked up his whiskey bottle at last and poured two glasses. perhaps a drink, captain the captain was watching the sky outside the window. the end end of the project gutenberg ebook of test rocket, by jack douglas
